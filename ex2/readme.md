# Exercice 2

## What was used

Some modifications were done on the code of Exercice 1.
- The history feature is basically just a printf of a 2D array.
- This array is created by copying the input into it. The function `strcpy` in `string.h` library was used to do this task. 


## Running the code

Open the terminal and run this code normally (can only be run in the terminal shell and NOT in an IDE).

```bash
gcc -o ex2 ex2.c
./ex2
```
